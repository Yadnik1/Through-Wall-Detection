# Through-Wall Detection Using UWB Radar System

Through-wall radar systems have grown immensely popular due to their potential applications in military and civil sectors. These systems aim to detect objects, especially humans, present inside rooms or structures, shielded by walls.

## Getting Started

1. Please clone the Repository.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. In the GUI, please select the `InputData - 29Mar20223a` file.
4. Proceed by clicking on "Process Data".

## Mathematical Formulation

Let a particular “range sector (±70⁰) be divided into 14 sections of 10 deg each, 7 on each side...

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a UWB Radar system for imaging to obtain electromagnetic images from behind or through walls. The technique provides an electromagnetic "vision" behind walls to detect, count, and localize individuals inside a room or building.
